    "### 1. What is Supervised Learning?\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning:** you have `input variables (X)` and an `output variable (y)` and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output $\\rightarrow y = f(X)$\n",
    "- The foundation for all predictive modeling machine learning (ML) algorithms\n",
    "- **Goal:** is to approximate the real underlying mapping so well that when you have new `input data (X)`, you can predict the `output variables (y)` for that data\n",
    "- Called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process\n",
    "- The teacher knows the correct answers; the algorithm (or students) iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by making updates\n",
    "- Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance\n",
    "- **Sliding window method:** The use of prior time steps to predict the next time step; also called window method and in statistics and TSA, this is called a **lag** or lag method; turn time series problem to supervised learning problem; the larger the window size, the more time series steps in window\n",
    "- **Univariate Time Series:** Datasets where only a single variable is observed at each time, such as temperature each hour\n",
    "- **Multivariate Time Series:** Datasets where two or more variables are observed at each time\n",
    "- **One-step Forecast:** At (given) `t (as an input feature (X))`, the next time step `y = t + 1` is predicted\n",
    "- **Multi-step Forecast:** At (given) `t (as an input feature (X))`, predict `y_n = t + n` and `y_n = t + n + 1`, where n > 1 so t + 2, t + 3...\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why is X important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transforming from a time series to a supervised learning problem allows you access to the suite of standard linear and nonlinear ML algorithms on your problem\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are some applications of X? What other concepts can I connect to X? Use FE when...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems\n",
    "    - Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as red and blue or disease and no disease\n",
    "    - Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as dollars or weight\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is the evolution/history of X?\n",

    "### 5. Can I predict the future use of X? How can this current usage of X improve?\n",
